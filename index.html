<div>
<p>You’ve learned a powerful tool in JavaScript: control flow! It’s so powerful, in fact, that it can be used to tell someone’s fortune.</p>

<p>In this project we will build a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.</p>

<p>The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>0/9 Complete</p>
<p><em>Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p>In the first line of the program, define a variable called userName that is set to an empty string.</p>

<p>If the user wants, they can enter their name in between the quotation marks.</p>

  </li>
<li>
<p>Below this variable, create a ternary expression that decides what to do if the user enters a name or not. If the user enters a name — like 'Jane' — use string interpolation to log Hello, Jane! to the console. Otherwise, simply log Hello!.</p>

<li>
<p>Create a variable named userQuestion. The value of the variable should be a string that is the question the user wants to ask the Magic Eight Ball.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Write a <code>console.log()</code> for the userQuestion, stating what was asked. You can include the user’s name in the <code>console.log()</code> statement, if you wish!</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>We need to generate a random number between 0 and 7.</p>

<p>Create another variable, and name it randomNumber. Set it equal to this expression, which uses two methods (<code>Math.floor()</code> and <code>Math.random()</code>) from the Math library.</p>

<code>Math.floor(Math.random() * 8);</code>
<p>Check the hint to learn how it works!</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Create one more variable named eightBall, and set it equal to an empty string. We will save a value to this variable in the next steps, depending on the value of randomNumber.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>We need to create a control flow that takes in the randomNumber we made in step 5, and then assigns eightBall to a reply that a Magic Eight Ball would return. Think about utilizing if/else or switch statements. Here are 8 Magic Eight Ball phrases that we’d like to save to the variable eightBall:</p>
<ol>
<li>'It is certain'</li>
<li>'It is decidedly so'</li>
<li>'Reply hazy try again'</li>
<li>'Cannot predict now'</li>
<li>'Do not count on it'</li>
<li>'My sources say no'</li>
<li>'Outlook not so good'</li>
<li>'Signs point to yes'</li>
</ol>
<p>If the randomNumber is 0, then save an answer to the eightBall variable; if randomNumber is 1, then save the next answer, and so on. If you’re feeling creative, make your own responses!</p>

<li>
<p>Write a <code>console.log()</code> to print the Magic Eight Ball’s answer, the value of the eightBall variable.</p>

<li>
<p>Run your program a few times to see random results appear in the console!</p>

<p><strong>If you want extra practice:</strong></p>

<p>If you started with a switch statement, convert it to if/else if/else statements.</p>
<p>If you started with if/else if/else statements, convert them to a switch statement.</p>
